## Gotta Go Fast!!
The fast, blue ball that we all know and love needs more golden rings. This program exercises light position based on mouse movement, 3D objects, and camera functions.

Light reflects off the blue ball depending on your **mouse position**.

Includes **three toruses** that rotate in place.

Featuring yourself! Allow the **camera** and you will see yourself on the stage.
